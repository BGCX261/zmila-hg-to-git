	Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, 
	a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

			38 17 16 15 14 13 30
			39 18  5  4  3 12 29
			40 19  6  1  2 11 28

	It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, 
	but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; 
	that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
	If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, 
	a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, 
	what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals 
	first falls below 10%?"
